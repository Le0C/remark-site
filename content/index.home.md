## about me

hello : ) 

## about this site

This site was built using a custom static site generator I built in 2020 using the [unifiedjs](https://unifiedjs.com/) ecosystem. I did this as an exercise to learn more about site generation, and because I found the unified ecosystem fascinating, both in concept and to work with. The result was [remark-site](https://github.com/techtestleo/remark-site).

In 2021 I forked and repurposed the repo to become the static site builder for my gh-pages site.
